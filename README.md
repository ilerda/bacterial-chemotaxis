# bacterial-chemotaxis
Simulates bacterial chemotaxis in a field of varying sugar density

The amount of sugar density varies in this two dimenstional field. The bacteria undergo seemingly random motion but due to chemotaxis eventually end up at the peak density of sugar.

By changing the parameter K it is possible to determine the sensitivity of the bacteria to the surrounding field.
